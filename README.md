# Responsive Club Website - Codecademy Challenge Project

__Project Goals__

In this project, I'll be building my own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen! ​

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:​

* Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
* Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
* Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
*
